# An√°lise de imagem 4.0 com AI Vision Service

## DIO challenge for the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals certification.

In this exercise, I used the tools available at the [Azure AI Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/gallery/featured) to try the AI Vision Service and evaluate a machine learning model.

It's the same example used in the web class of the [course](https://web.dio.me/track/microsoft-azure-ai-fundamentals).
